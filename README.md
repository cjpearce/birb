This my toy path tracer written in rust. It serves little purpose other than allowing me to learn about rust programming and path tracing at the same time.

The current `master` branch contains a very simple path tracer that began its life as a rust port of <https://github.com/hunterloftis/pathtracer>.
The project is built to run in the browser using Wasm and a live version can be found at <http://rust-pathtracer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/>.

The `pbr-rewrite` branch contains modifications I have started to experiment with while reading [The PBR Book](http://www.pbr-book.org/), although they are very incomplete and the branch mainly exists as a scratchpad while I read the material.
